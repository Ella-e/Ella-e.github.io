I am a final year Computer Science undergradute at [School of Computing](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/), [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/). 

With a passion in solving real-world problems, my research intersts lie in Embodied AI and Dexterous Manipulation. I am currently doing my Final Year Project about Robot Manipulation under the supervision of Prof. Lin SHAO. Iâ€™m actively seeking PhD opportunities beginning in August 2026 and am always open to new collaborations - please feel free to reach out~

## INTERNSHIP & WORK EXPERIENCE
* Research Intern, Agency For Science and Technology, CFAR, Singapore May 2024 - Aug 2024
  * Explored diffusion-based dataset distillation methods.
  * Investigated the impact of mixing real and synthesized images on model performance.

* AI Intern, Tencent, Beijing, China Feb 2022 - Jun 2022
  * Proposed and implemented a solution to reduce false positive rates in Tencent Video AI-based Black/Blurred screen detection network; improved model's recall and accuracy by about 5% after deployment online.
  * Conducted in-depth research and experimentation on diverse loss functions and sampling methods for Tencent News' large-scale multi-label text classification network, leading to a 3% improvement in precision.
